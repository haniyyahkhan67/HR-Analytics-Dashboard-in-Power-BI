# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-in-Power-BI
This project showcases a dynamic and in-depth HR Analytics Dashboard built entirely in Power BI, designed to deliver actionable insights into employee attrition trends and workforce behavior. The goal is to support HR leaders, analysts, and decision-makers in understanding the driving forces behind attrition and optimizing retention strategies.

The dashboard brings clarity to complex datasets and transforms raw HR data into a strategic asset, allowing users to explore key workforce metrics through an intuitive, interactive visual interface.

What This Dashboard Delivers
This dashboard isn’t just a collection of charts—it's a strategic tool to answer critical business questions such as:

Which departments and roles are losing the most employees?

What age groups are at the highest risk of attrition?

Is there a link between salary levels and employee turnover?

How long do employees typically stay before leaving?

Are certain genders or job categories experiencing higher attrition?

Key Metrics & Highlights
Employee Count: 1,473

Total Attritions: 237

Attrition Rate: 16.1%

Average Monthly Salary: 6.5K

Total Combined Experience: 17,000+ Years

These headline KPIs offer a bird’s-eye view of the organization’s workforce status and attrition challenges.

Advanced Visualizations Included
The dashboard incorporates a diverse range of analytical visuals, each tailored to reveal a different dimension of attrition:

Donut Chart – Breakdown of attrition by employee specialization

Bar Charts – Attrition by age group, job role, salary slab, and years at the company

Line Chart – Attrition trend based on tenure

Matrix Table – Cross-tabulated view of job roles against attrition frequency

Slicers – Interactive filters for department and gender, enabling deep dive analysis

These visuals are not only informative but also allow for real-time exploration of the data, giving users control over the narrative.

Tools & Techniques Used
Power BI Desktop for data visualization and model creation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for dynamic metrics and calculated fields

Data Modeling to establish relationships and build a reliable semantic layer

Data Cleaning and transformation within Power BI Query Editor

Strategic Use Cases
This dashboard can be adopted in multiple professional scenarios:

HR Strategy Meetings – Use it to communicate trends to senior leadership

Employee Retention Planning – Identify problem areas and optimize intervention

Workforce Planning – Support long-term staffing, hiring, and upskilling efforts

Performance Audits – Correlate attrition with performance and compensation patterns

Data Source
The underlying dataset is a cleaned and preprocessed HR dataset representing a fictional company, structured to resemble real-world organizational data. It includes anonymized employee records across departments, salary bands, gender, job roles, and years of service.

Conclusion
This project is a demonstration of how data storytelling in Power BI can elevate raw HR metrics into strategic decision-making tools. By centralizing employee insights and attrition trends into a single dashboard, organizations can reduce guesswork and take a proactive stance in employee engagement and retention.
